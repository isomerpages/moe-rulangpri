<p>Since its inception in 2006, the Parents Support Group (PSG) of Rulang
Primary School has played a pivotal role in engaging parents of our existing
students, in support of our children's education. In strengthening ties
with the School, the PSG actively participates and supports in various
school programmes and functions such as the annual Racial Harmony Day celebrations,
Mother Tongue Fortnight and Earth Day activities, just to name a few. Since
2014, the PSG also leads the organisation of the annual Teachers' Day Concert
in appreciation of our children's dedicated teachers, through performances
and gifts put together by participating parents and selected students.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add value to our pupils' learning in the social and moral domains,
the School has also invited the PSG to introduce new initiatives to support
talks and workshops for our children, in areas such as cyberwellness and
mental well-being. Networking workshops, field trips and interest workshops
are also periodically organised by the PSG for fellow parents. Parenting
Parents Workshops are also being developed to enhance mutual parents support.
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PSG truly believes that parental involvement in the School and PSG
programmes and events sends strong signals to our children that their parents
have keen interest in their education and learning journey, thereby leading
to stronger bonds forged within the family. &nbsp;</p>
