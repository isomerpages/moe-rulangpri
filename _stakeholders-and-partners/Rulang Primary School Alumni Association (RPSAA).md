<h1>Rulang Primary School Alumni Association (RPSAA)</h1>
<p>Since its inception in 1998 by a group of passionate alumni, the Rulang
Primary School Alumni Association (RPSAA) aims to foster a strong bond
among former Rulangnites and support our Alma Mater. It also serves as
a platform for alumni to reconnect, conribute, and make a positive impact
on Rulang Primary School.</p>
<p>Led by visionary leaders such as Mr. Chew Chin Seng, Mr. Tan Teck Yoke,
Mr. Wee Hang Yong, Mr. Tan Poh Kok and presently Mr. Aaron Tan, the RPSAA
has continuously strived to foster fellowship among its members, while
nurturing a profound love and commitment to Rulang Primary School.</p>
