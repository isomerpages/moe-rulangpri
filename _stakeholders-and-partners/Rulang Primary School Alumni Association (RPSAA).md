<h1>Rulang Primary School Alumni Association (RPSAA)</h1>
<p>Since its inception in 1998 by a group of passionate alumni, the Rulang
Primary School Alumni Association (RPSAA) aims to foster a strong bond
among former Rulangnites and support our Alma Mater. It also serves as
a platform for alumni to reconnect, conribute, and make a positive impact
on Rulang Primary School.</p>
<p>Led by visionary leaders such as Mr. Chew Chin Seng, Mr. Tan Teck Yoke,
Mr. Wee Hang Yong, and presently Mr. Tan Poh Kok, the RPSAA has continuously
strived to foster fellowship among its members, while nurturing a profound
love and commitment to Rulang Primary School.</p>
<p><strong>At the heart of our mission lies several core objectives:</strong>
</p>

nurturing strong bonds and camaraderie among Rulangnites, creating a supportive

<li>
<p><strong>Honouring Our Alma Mater: </strong>The association aims to demonstrate
unwavering loyalty and support for Rulang Primary School by preserving
the school’s legacy and contributing to its continued growth and success.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<li>
<p><strong>Advancing Education: </strong>Seeking to deepen understanding
and appreciation of the school's ethos, the association actively engages
with educational initiatives that enrich the learning journey of current
students.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Through the years, the RPSAA has played a pivotal role in the transformation
of our Alma Mater, from its humble beginnings as a village school to a
school of excellence today. Through both financial assistance and expertise
support, the association has championed numerous talent development programmes,
providing opportunities for current Rulangnites to succeed.</p>
<p>The RPSAA’s contributions extend far and wide, including sponsorship for <strong>scholarships for the top 3 pupils of each level, CCA Individual Outstanding Achievement Awards</strong>, <strong>Student All Round Achievement Award</strong>,
and the <strong>Passion Fund</strong> for students in the GEP programme.</p>
<h4><strong>Events and Activities</strong></h4>
<p>A variety of engaging events and activities are organised by the RPSAA.
This includes the annual Chinese New Year Reunion Dinner held at Rulang
Primary School, where alumni, school staff and the parent support group
would gather and bond over a joyous dinner, with performances by various
CCA groups and a grand auction facilitated by the generous participation
of alumni members.</p>
<p>Additionally, the association organises the Mid-Autumn Festival celebration
annually, providing opportunities for alumni members and their families
to partake in the festivities as part of the big Rulang family. These events,
among others, are part of the RPSAA's ongoing efforts to foster connections
and create meaningful experiences with fellow Rulangnites.</p>
