<h1>Rulang Primary School Alumni Association (RPSAA)</h1>
<p>A group of passionate alumni started the Rulang Primary School Alumni
Association (RPSAA) in 1998 and the feelings of attachment have been strong
through the years. The Alumni Association’s first president was <strong>Mr Chew Chin Seng</strong> who
helmed the association from its inception to 2002 after which the mantle
of leadership was passed on to <strong>Mr Tan Teck Yoke</strong> who led
the association to 2016, after serving the association for 14 years. <strong>Mr Wee Hang Yong</strong> was
elected to be the third president of the society in 2016.</p>
<p><strong>The main objectives of the RPSAA are:</strong>
</p>
