<p>Pupils will learn some aspects of Innovention, Entrepreneurship and Student
Leadership and apply the knowledge and skills learnt to become The Little
Trainers. They will understand the difference between “Invention” and “Innovation”,
identify a problem that they would like to solve, analyse an existing product
to be improved upon and apply SCAMPER as an idea generating tool to solve
their problem. By using the design thinking process to understand consumer
needs, pupils will acquire some entrepreneurial skills. Their approach
will be strengthened by Arthur L.&nbsp;Costa’s 2 Habits of Mind - Applying
Past Knowledge To New Situations, Learning Continuously and Peter Senge’s
Five Disciplines of a Learning Organisation.</p>

<p>CCA groups will be paired by choice and led by the CCA Leaders, design
a 1-hour workshop to teach the P2 pupils a skill or to make a product.
After a sneak peek (rapping, skit, etc) of their presentation to the P2
pupils during recess, P2 pupils will complete a survey to indicate their
top 3 choices of what they would like to learn. A day will be set aside
for this training to take place.</p>

<p>Through the SP sessions, pupils will gain valuable skills so that they
can handle real-world projects that engage a multidisciplinary team. They
will learn habits of mind that prepare them to take responsible risks;
ask and pose good, appropriate questions; and learn to think and communicate
clearly and precisely. They will acquire new Science concepts and process
skills as they navigate the world of innovation and inventions. As they
look at different examples of invention and innovation, they will need
to tap into design thinking such as empathy, ideation, prototyping and
testing. Finally, they will understand the basics of marketing as they
explore the world of advertising and marketing.</p>

<p>With the skills they learnt, pupils will embark into different teams to
focus on either Entrepreneurship or Design Thinking. During this portion
of the SP process, teachers will facilitate pupils in their own pursuit
as they become Young Entrepreneurs, or Young Designers to solve a real-world
problem.</p>

<p>The P4 pupils go through the Young Environmentalist Sustainability (Y.E.S.)
project to teach them the importance of 3 “C” - connect, collaborate and
create. The pupils are connected to the real-world situation of environmental
concerns and sustainability. Pupils will have the opportunity to collaborate
and learn to apply the 3 Habits of Mind which are thinking flexibility,
thinking about thinking and thinking interdependently to develop good habits
when working in teams. For the project, the pupils are taught applying
the process skills such as defining a problem, brainstorming ideas, and
applying SCAMPER techniques as an idea generating tools to solve problem.
They will then create and test solution with their prototype.</p>
