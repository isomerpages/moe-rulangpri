# Programme for Active Learning


**Programme for Active Learning (PAL)**

In Rulang Primary School, all Primary 1 and 2 pupils undergo PAL modules as part of the holistic education during the curriculum time. PAL modules provide pupils with broad exposure in three areas- **Performing and Visual Arts, Sports and Games and Outdoor Education.**

The implementation of PAL provides additional platforms to realise the desired outcomes of education, i.e. for every pupil to be a **confident** **person**, a **self-directed** **learner**, an **active** **contributor** and a **concerned** **citizen** as reflected in the objectives of the programme below.

To develop  

*   confidence as they enjoy individual and group experiences through active participation   
    
*   self-directed learners with a social conscience to want to contribute to society at large   
    
*   a sense of curiosity, creativity and adaptability as a result of their PAL experiences   
    
*   self-expression of thoughts and ideas through experimentation


The philosophy that guides us in the PAL implementation is our belief in providing a supportive and inviting social environment to make learning fun and engaging. With that, PAL lessons are crafted based on the unique **P.R.I.S.M** strategy- **Play. Rehearse. Internalise. Shine. Motivate.**  
  
In summary, PAL aims to facilitate the well-rounded development of pupils in the five learning domains (cognitive, moral, social, aesthetics and physical) and help pupils to develop social emotional competencies.
