The Physical Education (PE) programme plays an important role in the physical growth and development of pupils. It provides an avenue for them to express themselves non-verbally and creatively through movement and physical activity.

Physical activity should be the cornerstone of the PE programme. The delivery of PE determines how pupils will feel about making physical activities a part of their lifestyle. The PE programme for pupils should be enjoyable to ensure that they develop a positive association with physical activity .PE lessons should include meaningful discussions to promote interaction and the fundamental understanding of basic health-related concepts.

In addition, PE provides a natural platform and valuable opportunities to inculcate self- management skills, social and cooperative skills and to build character. It serves to complement other educational area in promoting educational outcomes that are less likely to be achieved in other subject areas.

**Principles of Teaching and Learning**

We use a thematic approach to plan our Health Promotion Programmes in Rulang. In term 1, we focus on mental / emotional health. In Term 2, we focus on physical health. In Term 3, we focus on nutrition and in Term 4, we focus on social health. We strongly feel that health promotion initiatives should be all year round so as to lead our staff, pupils and stakeholders towards healthy living. Our holistic health programme, comprising of physical, social and emotional well-being, is customized, integrated to impact the whole school.

It is our belief that performance and well-being will be enhanced in a health promoting school. Embedded in our school vision,“A Gallery of Scholars, a Vibrant Community of Wholesome Individuals” is our commitment to Character and skills development. To fulfill our mission “to cultivate in pupils sound moral and social values, to strive for academic excellence, to develop each pupil to the limits of his abilities and to help each pupil grow into a healthy, happy and responsible individual”, the development of holistic health is essential.

**Objectives**

* collaborate with teachers, students, parents, external vendors and stakeholders to promote holistic health.

# Co-Curricular and Special Programme(CCSP)

**Vision**<br>
Inspiring Excellence, Nurturing Talents

**Mission**<br>
Nurturing Wholesome Individuals, Reaching Maximum Potential

**Philosophy**

The Co-Curricular activities & Special Programmes (CCSP) introduced are aligned to the school’s vision, mission and thrusts. They not only complement the curriculum, but are also rapidly evolving as integral parts of the curriculum.

Participating in CCSPs offer opportunities for pupils to develop multiple intelligences and engage in meaningful social interactions with their teachers and peers. Also, through the planned activities, pupils undergo experiences which afford them the opportunity to enhance character and uplift their ethics. These experiences hone self-discipline skills which are crucial if they were to develop their highest potential.

In Rulang, involvement in CCSPs is an avenue for pupils to gain the experience of competing against others which helps to develop their resilience and perseverance in overcoming challenges and striving for excellence. In addition, the cognitive, emotional and moral well-being of the pupils will always be placed above the desire and pressure to achieve.

Therefore, participation in CCSP creates a valuable opportunity for each pupil to improve himself/herself emotionally and physically.

**Principles of Teaching and Learning**

The CCSP committee recognizes the demands placed upon the staff and pupils and understand the need to provide them with the support, tools, and skills necessary for them to achieve the expected learning outcomes.

Working on a system similar to Texton's Talent Development Model (shown in the diagram above), the committee ensures that:

* staff and pupils are carefully selected and matched to CCAs based on their competencies, so as to enhance the possibilities for realisation of potential 
* clear directions and feedback are provided so that every staff, coach and pupil understands the expectations of the school and how their efforts impact the overall success of the CCSP 
* support is provided for staff and pupils to enable them to build their capabilities to meet demands and sustain achievements, as well as expand possibilities beyond the present 
* pupils are trained in skills that allow them to establish individual accomplishments, in addition to affording them an advantage over their peers as they move on to secondary schools 

**Objectives**

The objectives of the CCSP:
* Provide challenging and fun experiences for pupils to cater to their educational and psychomotor developmental needs 
* Develop policies and systems to ensure effectiveness and efficiency of the CCA structure in school 
* Carry out evaluation of CCA programmes in terms of their values to the holistic development of the pupil 


**Learning Outcomes**
The learning outcomes of the CCSP:

* Sense of responsibility and leadership 
* Value of teamwork 
* Camaraderie and Espirit-de-corps 
* Drive towards establishing a culture of self-improvement 
* Develop creativity and spark curiosity 
* Care and concern amongst classmates and peers 
* Confidence and etiquette 

The CCSP includes both the CCAs and Special Programmes (SP) and it involves pupils from Primary 3 to 6. During SP, pupils undergo a series of experiential learning modules where they will be exposed to a range of thinking and life skills. These modules have been classified into 3 main categories, namely Culture and Aesthetics, Innovation and Enterprise, and Student Leadership.
