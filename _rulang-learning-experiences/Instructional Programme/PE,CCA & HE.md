<p>The Physical Education (PE) programme plays an important role in the physical
growth and development of pupils. It provides an avenue for them to express
themselves non-verbally and creatively through movement and physical activity.</p>
<p>Physical activity should be the cornerstone of the PE programme. The delivery
of PE determines how pupils will feel about making physical activities
a part of their lifestyle. The PE programme for pupils should be enjoyable
to ensure that they develop a positive association with physical activity.</p>
<p>In addition, PE provides a natural platform and valuable opportunities
to inculcate self-management skills, social and cooperative skills and
to build character. It serves to complement other subject areas in promoting
educational outcomes.</p>
<h4><strong>Principles of Teaching and Learning</strong></h4>
<p>The PE syllabus focuses on developing pupils’ motor and game skills and
equipping them with the knowledge, skills and attitudes to pursue and enjoy
a physically active and healthy lifestyle.</p>

<h3><strong>Health Education</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Principles of Teaching and Learning</strong></h4>
<p>We use a thematic approach to plan our Health Education Programmes in
Rulang. In Semester 1, we focus on Safety and Physical Health. In Semester
2, we focus on nutrition, mental well-being and emotional health. We believe
that health promotion initiatives should be all year round so as to lead
our staff, pupils and stakeholders towards healthy living. Our holistic
health programmes are customized and integrated into the curriculum to
impact the whole school.</p>
