<h1>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</h1>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Self-disciplined and Gracious Rulangnites</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture self-disciplined and gracious Rulangnites in a warm, caring
and supportive school environment.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum Content</strong></h4>
<p>The curriculum content of Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) is
based on the three big ideas of Identity, Relationships, and Choices, with
a central focus on developing a sense of purpose in our students. We believe
in nurturing Citizen Leaders who are responsible to their family and community
and understand their roles in shaping the future of our nation. Our aim
is to enable each student to develop a sense of culture, history, passion,
purpose, identity, belonging, and personality that form their distinctive
backbone and character.</p>

<p>CCE at Rulang Primary School is central to our mission of nurturing well-rounded
individuals who are equipped with the values, skills, and dispositions
to thrive in an ever-changing world. Rulang views character development
as a vital vehicle to achieve the school vision of being “Scholars of Tomorrow”.</p>
<p>Our CCE curriculum is designed with careful consideration of global developments
impacting our society, such as societal changes, globalization, and technological
advancements. Aligned with MOE's CCE 2021 Curriculum Framework, our curriculum
is anchored on the school's A.B.L.E desired outcomes and D.A.R.E. values.</p>
<h4><strong>Enactment of CCE</strong></h4>
<p>At Rulang Primary School, we are committed to providing a holistic CCE
experience for our students. Our approach is tailored to cultivate a caring
and enabling learning environment that nurtures the growth and development
of our students.</p>

<p>Embracing a caring and enabling environment as a whole-school approach,

<p>Our Rulangnites are also taught Executive Functioning Skills to enhance
their ability to manage their learning and adapt to new challenges. These
skills are essential for tasks such as planning, organizing, strategizing,
maintaining attention to and recalling details, and effectively managing
time and space. This approach fosters a holistic education that extends
beyond academic achievement.</p>

<p><strong>Student Engagement and Ownership</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We actively encourage student voice and ownership, ensuring that our students
feel included and empowered. Acknowledging their views and ideas, we strive
to motivate every Rulangite to contribute positively and strive for excellence.
For example, RPOP! - Rulangnites: Pursuing Our Passions, is a pupil-led
initiative that empowers students to start interest groups with their peers,
encouraging them to explore their interests and collaborate with others.</p>

<p><strong>Community Engagement and Contribution</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Our Values-In-Action (VIA) programmes and school-customized initiatives
empower students to contribute meaningfully to the community. From contributing
to the Jurong community to global initiatives, our students develop a sense
of responsibility and care for the shared spaces within and beyond the
school. Grounded in our school's core values, our D.A.R.E. values aim to
develop a sense of service and responsibility in our students. Through
lessons on current social, regional, and global issues, we provide opportunities
for students to become reflective global citizens who make a positive impact
on the lives of others and the environment.</p>

<p><strong>National Education and Citizenship Events</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Embracing National Education, we commemorate core annual events such as
Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, and
National Day. These events provide our students with a holistic learning
experience and foster a sense of national identity and pride.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><u>Total Defence Day (TDD)</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>TDD is commemorated in February (Term 1) every year and remains relevant
to deal with the ever-evolving hybrid threats and challenges to Singapore.
These include misinformation, supply chain disruptions and food security
that affect communities and Singaporeans' way of life. Every Rulangnite
has a part to play in our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is prepared
for crises or disruptions, and that we remain resilient and united.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>International Friendship Day (IFD)</u>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>International Friendship Day is celebrated every year to encourage our
Rulangnites to connect with communities that are different from their own.&nbsp;
On this day, it is dedicated to the understanding of Singapore’s relations
with its neighbouring countries and beyond. It aims to nurture in our Rulangnites
the spirit of friendship and partnership among different countries and
people and to appreciate diverse cultures, different perspectives and ideas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><u>Racial Harmony Day (RHD)</u>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Day</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Rulangnites are reminded of the importance of maintaining racial and religious
harmony in the country on this day. Our students learn the importance of
making choices that promote and advocate inter-cultural understanding,
which build strong relationships between people of all races, cultures
and nationalities, and strengthen our distinctive identity as Singaporeans
living in multicultural Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>National Day</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The National Day celebration provides a good opportunity for Rulangnites
to reflect on how far Singapore has come since our independence in 1965
and understand that none of this would have been possible without sheer
grit and determination, a forward- looking government and unity among Singaporeans.</p>
