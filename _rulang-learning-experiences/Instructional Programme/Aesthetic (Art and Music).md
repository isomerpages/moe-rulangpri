**Philosophy**

The pervasiveness of the Aesthetics in the holistic development in our pupils cannot be under-estimated. It plays a vital role in the holistic development of our pupils and is very much prevalent in our daily lives.

In Rulang, we strive to equip our pupils with creativity and build self-esteem and confidence in them, and in the process, open doors to imagination and discovery. Daniel H.Pink (2005) stated that, “ the left hemisphere knows how to handle logic and the right hemisphere knows the world. Put the two together and one gets a powerful thinking machine.”. Hence it is crucial that our pupils attain the skills and processes in these areas during their fundamental years to enable them to develop and grow to their fullest potential. All Rulangnites are given the opportunity to explore the audio and visual world, communicate thoughts and feelings and form concepts about themselves and their environment. Aesthetics Education in Rulang is embraced through a developmental approach in equipping foundational skills in areas like visual arts, performing arts, literary arts and music.
