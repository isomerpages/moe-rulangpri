# Aesthetics

**Vision**

Reflective, Proactive and Sagacious aesthetes in a vibrant community

**Philosophy**

     style="width:70%">
The pervasiveness of the Aesthetics in the holistic development in our pupils cannot be under-estimated. It plays a vital role in the holistic development of our pupils and is very much prevalent in our daily lives.

In Rulang, we strive to equip our pupils with creativity and build self-esteem and confidence in them, and in the process, open doors to imagination and discovery. Daniel H.Pink (2005) stated that, “ the left hemisphere knows how to handle logic and the right hemisphere knows the world. Put the two together and one gets a powerful thinking machine.”. Hence it is crucial that our pupils attain the skills and processes in these areas during their fundamental years to enable them to develop and grow to their fullest potential. All Rulangnites are given the opportunity to explore the audio and visual world, communicate thoughts and feelings and form concepts about themselves and their environment. Aesthetics Education in Rulang is embraced through a developmental approach in equipping foundational skills in areas like visual arts, performing arts, literary arts and music.

# Visual Arts

**Rulang Aesthetics Xcellent (RAX)**

Rulang Primary School promotes excellence in the Visual Arts by providing opportunities for every pupil to experience it through: creative and fun lessons, learning journeys and assembly programmes. These authentic experiences in our Visual Arts Programme provide platforms for pupils to develop skills such as observation, interpretation and valuing diversity.

The spiral art curriculum, which is built upon the previous level on a yearly basis, also aims to expose pupils to different mediums as well as art forms. This is to enhance their creative and expressive capacities, thereby boosting their confidence and abilities. Pupils who develop a special interest or display artistic talent in specific areas are given further opportunities to specialise and develop their potential in the respective art forms. Through these programmes, Rulang pupils will be guided towards excellence in both the national and international arena.

Rulang’s pupils are given opportunities to develop their creativity, express and showcase themselves through various platforms and appreciate Singapore’s multi-cultural heritage through diverse learning experiences in Music throughout their primary school years. Thus, these provides opportunities for our pupils to demonstrate teamwork, values in action, develop social-emotional skills and leadership qualities which in turn hone the 21st century competencies.
