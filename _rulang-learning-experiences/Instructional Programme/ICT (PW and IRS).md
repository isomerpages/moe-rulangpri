<h1>ICT</h1>
<p>Aligned with the MOE EdTech Masterplan 2030 and the school’s vision, the
ICT Committee aims to nurture scholars of tomorrow, well-equipped with
emerging 21st-century competencies (E21CC) and digital literacy. The goals
of the Rulang EdTech implementation plan are:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EdTech as a capability multiplier
to foster E21CC and Digital Literacy</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EdTech to transform learning
environment</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers as designers and
facilitators of tech-enabled learning experiences.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EdTech to personalise learning
and provide individualised feedback</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Digital Literacy</strong></h4>
<p>Digital Literacy (DL) is defined as a set of knowledge, skills and dispositions
that would help Rulangnites to be confident, critical and responsible users
of digital technologies for information, communication and problem-solving.
Students will acquire digital skills across four components in the Find
Think Apply Create framework.</p>

<h4><strong>e-Pedagogies – Teachers as designers and facilitators of tech-enabled learning experiences</strong></h4>
<p>The school embraces e-Pedagogies to nurture self-directed and collaborative
innovators, with teachers serving as designers and facilitators of tech-enabled
learning experiences. This approach is integrated into the school’s standard
processes, encompassing the delivery of lessons and the development of
process skills for knowledge acquisition, as well as the promotion of critical,
adaptive, and inventive thinking.</p>
<p>Teachers apply Key Application of Technology (KAT) as the core pedagogical
consideration, guiding them to leverage the affordances of technology to
enhance learning. Departments and teachers leverage the Student Learning
Space (SLS) as a curriculum resource hub to enrich their teaching and learning
practices.</p>
