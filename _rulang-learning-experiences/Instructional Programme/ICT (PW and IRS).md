# ICT (PW and IRS)
## ICT / Innovation & Niche / PW / MRL

**Vision**
**“Everyone Can Do IT”**

The ICT committee envisions Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to be encompassed within the overall culture of the school through its infusion into the school’s standard processes including, delivery of lessons, developing process skills for knowledge acquisition, promotion of creative thinking, people development, and application of appropriate tools for enhanced efficiency in administration.

The four words articulated in the vision express for whom, how and why ICT is implemented:

ICT prepares the young to participate in a rapidly changing world in which almost all activities are increasingly transformed through access to varied and developing technology. It is crucial for pupils to know how to employ ICT to enable rapid and legal access to ideas and experiences from a wide range of people, communities and cultures. Increased capabilities in the use of ICT promote self-directed and collaborative learning as pupils are able to make informed judgements from the data gathered.
Stakeholders who are well-versed in ICT also enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of administration and communication, as well as allows for the creation of a conducive learning environment for pupils. ICT-based assessment provides an alternative form of review of pupils’ learning and performance.

**Objectives**

**The objectives of the ICT programmes are to:**

* Provide pupils with ICT enriched learning experiences and focusing on SDL and CoL.
* Provide opportunities for pupils to see the relevance of cyber wellness to their lives and acquire key cyber wellness skills.
* Provide accessibility of ICT to pupils through more flexible and mobile infrastructure provision.

**Desired Outcomes**

The desired outcome which we hope that pupils develop competencies for self-directed and collaborative learning through the effective use of ICT as well as become discerning and responsible ICT users.

**Ability-driven and Differentiated Teaching and Learning Programmes**

In harnessing potential as well as capabilities in pupils, ICT programme is differentiated to meet the learning needs of different groups of pupils. This notion is clearly charted below

# Media Resource Library
**Vision**

A haven where a community of learners becomes scholars.

**Philosophy**
![](/images/IMG_1479.jpg)
Print and the digital resources are the media that unlock the door of knowledge and wonderment.

The library is where our pupils uncover the complex, challenging yet mysterious and wonderful world around them. They explore and analyse a whole range of fiction and non-fiction, from Shakespeare to the sciences.

Through a myriad of resources, books and digital media, our pupils will engage in scholarly activities to develop a deeper understanding of the richness and complexity of literature and its continuing relevance within our diverse global cultures. By the same means, the community of learners is enriched with what the sciences offer and their lives are enhanced by the world of arts and crafts.

Having acquired the richness of language from the literary works available, our pupils develop the power to express their thoughts, feelings and aspirations in a logical, creative and imaginative way.

Rulang Primary School has mapped a learning journey so that interesting and diversed learning can take place for the pupils. And Media Resource Library, in its main or supportive role, will work together to provide the necessary resources available.
