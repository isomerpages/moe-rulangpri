<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Inquiring Minds, Lifelong Learners</p>
<h4><strong>Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>Science is a fascinating exploration of the world around us, encompassing
a wealth of knowledge. At Rulang, we see the study of Science as an exciting
journey to understand and appreciate our environment. This journey involves
developing skills and processes that enable the acquisition, synthesis,
evaluation, and application of this knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In our approach, we celebrate Science through engaging and diverse
activities and programmes at different levels, aiming to instil a spirit
of scientific inquiry. We believe that learning Science extends beyond
the confines of the classroom. To enrich students' experiences and deepen
their understanding, we emphasise problem-solving and practical investigations
of the environment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Science is not just taught in Rulang, it is experienced. Students
not only grasp the subject matter but also develop an appreciation for
the diversity found in both Physical and Life Sciences. By harnessing knowledge,
understanding, application skills, ethical considerations and positive
attitudes, we aspire to empower our students to think beyond what they
can learn from the textbooks.</p>
<h4><strong>Programmes and Activities</strong></h4>
<h4>Nature Study @ Our Learning Gardens</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Exploring the wonders of Science extends beyond the confines of
the classrooms. Our Learning Gardens, comprising the TRUE HEARTs Garden
and Rain Garden, were one of the ten community gardens conferred the Garden
of the Year Awards (GOYA) by NParks in 2023. The gardens offer students
exciting hands-on opportunities and experiences. Through experiential learning,
they can uncover the fascinating connections between plants and animals
and develop essential process skills.</p>

<h4>Science Fiesta!</h4>
<p>Science Fiesta! is a week-long celebration of studentsâ€™ successes and
achievements in Science and Environmental Education. Pupils will be immersed
in a week filled with engaging Science and Environmental programmes and
activities, which includes a Jumble Sale of pre-loved items donated by
staff and students. The school collaborates with external organisations
like Science Centre Singapore, NParks and National Environment Agency to
bring live online lessons and exhibition booths tailored for different
levels. It is also held in conjunction with International Friendship Day,
which adds another layer of celebration to the event.&nbsp;</p>
