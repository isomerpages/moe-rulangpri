# English
**Vision and Philosophy**

**Vision**
Confident Competent Communicators

**Philosophy**

English, like all other languages, is a means of communication and expression. English has become the medium by which most of us gain access to information and knowledge from around the world. In Rulang, the English Language Department is committed in providing high quality English Language learning experiences for our pupils through the integration of literacy skills – speaking, listening, reading and writing. We adopt various strategies to equip our pupils with skills to express themselves effectively in both speech and writing.
