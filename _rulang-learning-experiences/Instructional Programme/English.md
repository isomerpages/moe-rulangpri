<h1>English Language Department</h1>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>Confident and Competent Communicators</p>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>In Rulang, we are committed in providing high quality English Language
learning experiences for our pupils through the integration of literacy
skills – speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The learning experiences
we provide and the strategies we adopt help to equip our pupils with the
skills to express themselves effectively and empathetically in speech and
writing, to be discerning readers and creative inquirers.</p>

<h4><strong>Learning Opportunities in Rulang</strong></h4>
<h4>Our Experiential Learning Programmes</h4>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>“I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>~ Confucius</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Learning about Animals</strong></h4>
<p>Aligned to STELLAR Big Books ‘<em>Walking Through the Jungle</em>’ and
‘<em>Crocodile Tea</em>’, our Primary One pupils learn fun facts about
animals through their interactions with them. Pupils observe and learn
the characteristics of live animals and artefacts from the interactive
stations set up for the little ones. Our school hall certainly turned into
a mini zoo on this special day, much to the delight of our pupils.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Postcards to David</strong></h4>
<p>Taken from the Primary Two STELLAR Big Book ‘<em>Postcards to David’</em> our
Rulangnites learn the structure of a postcard and how to write them. They
also mail the completed work to their loved ones. Imagine their delight
when they see their family members receiving the postcards!</p>

<h4><strong>Class Party</strong></h4>
<p>Every child must be invited to at least one party. So, why not a class
party? During this programme, our Primary Two pupils play party games with
their friends and learn about turn taking and playing collaboratively.</p>

<h4><strong>Carnivorous Plants</strong></h4>
<p>“Plants eat insects?”</p>
<p>Our Primary Three pupils’ eyes lit up when they observe mother nature
work her magic during this exciting programme that is aligned to the STELLAR
topic on ‘<em>Carnivorous Plants</em>’.</p>

<h4><strong>Ice Cream Making Workshop</strong></h4>
<p>Aligned to the Primary Four STELLAR topic on ‘<em>Making Ice Cream</em>’,
pupils experience how to make ice cream using the freezing method. The
experience is even sweeter as everyone gets to enjoy the ice cream that
they have made at the end of the programme.</p>

<h4><strong>Our RulangReads Programme</strong></h4>
<p>The foundation of mastering any language is through reading. In Rulang,
we provide many reading opportunities for our pupils.</p>
<p>We support NLB’s <strong>Read for Books Charity Drive</strong> yearly by
involving the whole school. For every 10 people who read for fifteen minutes,
one book will be donated to selected beneficiaries.</p>

<h4><strong>Recess Reads</strong></h4>
<p>Our pupils can simply take a book from one of the Recess Reads shelves
in the canteen and read during their recess time or while waiting for after-school
programmes to begin. A book is a great company after all.</p>
