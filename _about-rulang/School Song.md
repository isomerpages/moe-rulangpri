# School Song

Hail, Alma mater Rulang School

May you stand like an evergreen

To spread culture and develop talent

To teach the ways of scholars

And make us see

The importance of respect for others

The toil and sweat of our fathers

We'll never forget

The advice of friends and teachers

We're sure to remember

With you we march forward courageously

With time

We progress together zealously.
