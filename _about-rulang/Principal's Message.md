<p>Welcome to Rulang Primary School!</p>
<p>Founded in 1930, Rulang Primary serves to provide an education for children
of a village community. Our school’s humble beginnings with 34 pupils housed
in a shophouse was anchored on a collective belief that the positive impact
of education nurtures not only confident learners, but also individuals
of character. While our context has evolved, this foundational purpose
remains at the heart of who we are today.</p>
<p>At Rulang, our mission centres on <strong>fostering a culture of care, excellence and innovation to develop empathetic, resilient and creative citizens who will contribute to a better tomorrow</strong>.
This guides the different aspect of life in our school and reflects both
our heritage and our hopes for the future.</p>
<p>We <strong>foster a culture of care</strong> by anchoring our school experience
in our D.A.R.E. values and in strong, trusting relationships. Within a
safe, inclusive and nurturing environment, our pupils grow in empathy and
moral courage, and develop a deep commitment to serve others and the wider
community. This caring ecosystem is also made possible through the strong
partnership of our School Advisory Committee, Alumni Association, Parents
Support Group, parents, as well as our local and overseas strategic partners,
all of whom have played pivotal roles in shaping the supportive environment
at Rulang. Above all, the unwavering commitment and dedication of our past
and present teaching and non-teaching staff have ensured that every Rulangnite
is known, valued and supported through an enriching and holistic school
experience.</p>
<p>We <strong>pursue excellence</strong> by nurturing a growth mindset in our
pupils and helping them understand excellence not just as a goal, but as
a lifelong journey of growth. We encourage our pupils to take pride in
effort, to persevere through setbacks, and to continually seek improvement.
By celebrating progress and learning from experiences, we help them develop
a mindset that values learning, character and integrity as much as outcomes.</p>
<p>We <strong>champion innovation</strong> by preparing our pupils for a world
that is complex, uncertain and non-linear. By nurturing critical thinking,
creativity, collaboration and adaptability, we equip them with the lifelong
competencies needed to thrive amidst change. Learning is designed to be
engaging and meaningful, empowering pupils with voice, agency and ownership
of their learning.</p>
<p>Guided by our mission, strengthened by our rich history and supported
by our stakeholders, partners and community, we remain committed to developing
empathetic, resilient and creative citizens—young scholars who are confident
in who they are, grounded in values, and ready to contribute meaningfully
towards a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>I invite you to join us in our mission to further our cause, and to see
Rulang Primary School grow from strength to strength as we journey towards
our centennial year.</p>
<p>Mrs Koh Chern Principal</p>
