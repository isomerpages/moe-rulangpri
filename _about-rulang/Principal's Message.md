2020 marks the 90th anniversary of Rulang Primary School, and it is my great honour to join a school which has distinguished herself as an institution of excellence, with a long illustrious history and sterling reputation of providing her pupils with unique holistic educational experiences. A common thread binds generations of Rulangnites – one of innovative thinking, coupled with a passion to learn and excel and a selfless dedication to lead, serve and contribute to society. From a humble village school of 34 pupils in 1930, Rulang has since established herself to be one of the most sought after schools in Jurong.  
  
Rulang’s success is attributed to its unique ‘people factor’. We have indeed been blessed with the support of our stakeholders, partners and community, and this has resulted in impactful collaborations that have in turn given rise to rich learning experiences and opportunities for our children. Our School Advisory Committee, Alumni Association, Parents Support Group, parents as well as our local and overseas strategic partners, have all played significant roles in shaping the identity of Rulang. The commitment and dedication of both past and present school leaders, middle managers, teaching and non-teaching staff, have ensured that every Rulangnite receives an enriching, value-added and holistic education.    
  
In alignment with Rulang’s vision of ‘Scholars of Tomorrow’, we are committed to cultivating pupils’ 21st century competencies and skills. Our desired outcomes are that pupils grow into A.B.L.E. Rulangnites, who are Accomplished Learners, Budding Entrepreneurs, Loyal Citizens and Empowered Leaders, equipped with both the competencies to stay relevant in a new economy, as well as the integrity and values to thrive in an uncertain world.    
  
Rooted in our TRUE HEARTs culture of excellence, collegiality and teamwork, we believe that the development of teachers’ capacities provide the engines of growth to the culture-building process so that our pupils are equipped with the essential skills and values to prepare themselves for the challenges of tomorrow.  
  
The hallmark of a fine school is its capacity to build on tradition while keeping pace with the challenges ahead, hence in this significant year of our 90th Anniversary, our hope for all Rulangnites is that we are ‘Anchored by Our Values, Lifted by Our Aspirations’. We are confident that with the continued support of our SAC and Alumni and with the parents and community partnering us, we can continue our important mission of ‘Nurturing Competencies, Inspiring Excellence, Empowering Individuals.’
