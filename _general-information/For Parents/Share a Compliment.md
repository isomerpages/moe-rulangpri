# Share a Compliment

Dear Parents,

Do you have compliments for any of our Rulang staff or teachers who have contributed and/or impacted in your children's learning? Or do you know of any Rulang staff or teachers who have gone out of their way to communicate and form a partnership with you? Are you impressed with any Rulang staff or teachers whose personal touch has contributed to your children's positive learning experiences in school? If YES to any of the above scenarios, you may want to pen a few words to compliment our staff or teachers. Please click [**HERE**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/about-us/compliments) for the online submission form.

Reasons for your compliments are not limited to the above examples only. Please feel free to share your positive experiences with any of our staff or teachers.

Compliments submitted will be rerouted to our Principal.

Thank you for your kind attention.
