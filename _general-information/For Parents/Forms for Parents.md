<h4><strong>(2) Parent Volunteer Registration Form</strong></h4>
<h4><strong>Parent Volunteer (PV) Application</strong></h4>
<p>Rulang Primary School values our Parent Volunteers' contribution to the
school and welcomes all interested parents to apply as Parent Volunteers
under our Parent Volunteer Scheme.</p>
<h4><strong>1. Eligibility</strong></h4>
<p>Parents of children born between 2 Jan 2021 and 1 Jan 2022 who are Singapore
Citizens (SC) or Singapore Permanent Residents (SPR) are eligible for this
programme.</p>
<h4><strong>2. Primary One Registration (Phase 2B)</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Under this Parent Volunteer Scheme, a parent may be able to register his/her
child under Phase 2B of the Primary One Registration Exercise if he/she
meets the following criteria:</p><pre><code>a.  Child is a Singapore Citizen or Singapore Permanent Residents&nbsp;
b.  Parent has joined the school as a Parent Volunteer and has contributed at least forty (40) hours of voluntary service to the school before June the year the child is due for P1 registration&nbsp;</code></pre>
<p></p>

<li>
<p>Please be informed that your child <strong>is not</strong> guaranteed a
place in Rulang Primary School under Phase 2B of the Primary 1 Registration
Exercise even with the completion of minimum forty (40) hours of voluntary
services. Balloting will be conducted should the number of applications
(including active community leaders) exceed the number of vacancies.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>4. Application Outcomes</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The selection of Parent Volunteers <strong>is not</strong> on a first-come,
first-served basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school reserves the right to select applicants whose proposed area
of contributions best meet the needs of the school and our students.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Important Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Based on the P1 registration for Rulang Primary School over the past few
years, balloting is usually conducted at Phase 2B. Priority admission to
a school will be given to children in this order:</p><pre><code>i.   Singapore Citizens living within 1km of the school&nbsp;
ii.  Singapore Citizens living between 1km and 2km of the school&nbsp;
iii. Singapore Citizens living outside 2km of the school&nbsp;
iv.  Permanent Residents living witihin 1km of the school&nbsp;
v.   Permanent Residents living between 1km and 2km of the school&nbsp;
vi.  Permanent Residents living outside 2km of the school&nbsp;&nbsp;</code></pre>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, in the selection of Parent Volunteers, greater consideration will
be given to parents of Singapore Citizen children who live within 1 km
from the school from the time of registration. This is in view of balloting,
if necessary, under Phase 2B, where citizenship and home-school distance
are considered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the past few years’ data, we typically accept no more than 12
parent volunteers each year. This is in consideration of the limited number
of vacancies we have under Phase 2B based on past years’ trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision of the School in the selection of Parent Volunteers is final
and the School is not obliged to give any reason for an unsuccessful application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All parents will be notified by School via email by 18 Aug 2026.</p>
