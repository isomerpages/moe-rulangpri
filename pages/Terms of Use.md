<p>3A. Account Access and Security</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>3A.1. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and

</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>3A.5. For the avoidance of doubt, you are solely responsible for any loss
of whatever nature arising from unauthorised or unofficial modifications
made to your device which permit or escalate privileged access, or remove
restrictions to such access, which are not intended by the manufacturer

or “jailbreaking” your mobile phone).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>4. Third Party Materials</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>4.1. The Service may require, enable or facilitate access to or use of
software or services of a third party (“<strong>Third Party</strong>”).
In such an event, there may be terms of use of the third party software
or service (the “<strong>Third Party Terms</strong>”). GovTech may be required
under or as a result of the Third Party Terms to notify you of certain
terms that apply to you (either directly as an end user, or as a party
whose acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms)
when you use the Services. An example of Third Party Terms may be open
source software terms or standard form terms of the distribution platform
from which you obtain any part of the Service (e.g. Google Play Store or
Apple App Store terms) which bind GovTech as a developer or user of the
distribution platform (the “<strong>Distribution Terms</strong>”). Information
on the Third Party Terms are embedded in the Service, already accounted
for in these Terms of Use, publicly available (e.g the Distribution Terms)
or otherwise listed in the Schedule herein.[1] For the avoidance of doubt,
insofar as this Clause 4 relates to the Distribution Terms, the relevant
Distribution Terms are the terms of the specific platform from which you
obtained a copy of the software or application that is part of the Service.
For example, if you obtained the said copy from the Google Play Store,
then the relevant terms are Google’s Distribution Terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4.2. <strong>It is your responsibility to check and read the most up-to-date versions of these Third Party Terms and you are deemed to have notice of the same</strong>.
In particular, you are deemed to have notice of the Third Party Terms that
GovTech (under the Third Party Terms) is required to notify you, and you
unconditionally agree to be bound by all the obligations in the Third Party
Terms which are applicable to you (whether as end user, or as a party whose
acts or omissions could cause GovTech to breach the Third Party Terms,
or otherwise). For the avoidance of doubt, where Third Party Terms are
listed, such Third Party Terms shall be deemed to include any privacy policies
and acceptable use policies as are applicable to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4.3. If the Third Party Terms require you to enter into an agreement directly
with the Third Party, then you unconditionally agree to enter into such
agreement, and in any event, to be legally bound by the Third Party Terms.
For the avoidance of doubt:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>4.3.1. some Third Party Terms (particularly open-source terms) permit
either a direct licence to you from the Third Party or a sublicence from
GovTech to you. In such cases, your licence is a direct licence from the
Third Party to you; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4.3.2. the terms of your agreement with the Third Party will govern your
use of the relevant third party software or service, and not these Terms
of Use.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>4.4. If the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly require GovTech to
incorporate certain terms in these Terms of Use (inclusive of terms which
impose any minimum or maximum standards herein, and/or terms described
in Clause 4.5 below), such terms are deemed to have been so incorporated
(the “<strong>Incorporated Terms</strong>”). Examples of Incorporated Terms
include provisions which require GovTech to give you notice of certain
rights and liabilities or require GovTech to ensure that you acknowledge
certain matters. Similarly, if the Third Party Terms expressly or impliedly
require these Terms of Use to be altered such that the Third Party Terms
are complied with, the parties herein agree that the Terms of Use shall
be deemed to be so altered but only to the extent necessary for compliance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4.5. Some Third Party Terms grant the Third Party, or require GovTech
to grant the Third Party, direct rights of enforcement of these Terms of
Use as a third party beneficiary, against you. Such Third Party Terms are
deemed to have been incorporated into these Terms of Use as Incorporated
Terms, and you hereby agree to grant such Third Party, such direct rights
of enforcement against you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4.6. For the avoidance of doubt, without prejudice to Clause 4.4, to the
extent of any inconsistency between these Terms of Use and the Third Party
Terms, the latter shall prevail provided nothing in the Third Party Terms
increases the liability of GovTech beyond that stated in Clause 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4.7. Without prejudice and in addition to the foregoing, GovTech shall
not be responsible for your use of any software or service of a Third Party.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5. Your Consent to Your Data and to Access Functions of Your Device</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>5.1. You hereby grant to GovTech a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual
and royalty-free right to collect, use, disclose, process, modify, adapt,
create derivative works of, reproduce, and sublicense any and all information
or data submitted, uploaded or shared by you to the extent necessary to
provide the Service or for any other purpose expressly or impliedly provided
in these Terms of Use, or as permitted by law.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5.2. Use of the Service may require you to allow access by the Service
to certain functions of your device, such as push notifications, the obtaining
and/or sharing of your location, or the collection of data from you in
connection with the Service. Your use of the Service shall constitute your
consent to the access by the Service of such functions of your device as
may be reasonably required by the Service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5.3. You further irrevocably and unconditionally waive, and shall cause
to be irrevocably and unconditionally waived, all existing and future moral
rights (including the right of identification) wherever in the world in
respect of any information or data submitted, uploaded or shared by you
(including feedback, requests or suggestions concerning the Services) to
GovTech. Such waiver shall also extend to GovTech’s licencees, assigns
and successors-in-title.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5.4. Please also see clause 8 (Privacy Statement).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>5A. Ownership of Feedback/Requests/Suggestions</strong>
</p>
<p>You agree that all title and interest in any feedback, requests or</p>
<p><strong>5B. Confidentiality</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>5B.1. If you receive information or data (in whatever form) from GovTech
or a Third Party which is designated confidential or proprietary or is
otherwise reasonably understood to be confidential or proprietary (collectively,
“<strong>Confidential Information</strong>”), you shall not use, disclose
or reproduce the Confidential Information except for the purpose for which
it was provided to you. If consent to disclose the Confidential Information
to a third party is given by GovTech or the Third Party to you, any act
or omission in respect of the Confidential Information by that person shall
be deemed to be your act or omission and you agree to be fully liable for
the same. In all cases, you shall protect the Confidential Information
to the same extent you protect your own confidential information but in
no event less than a reasonable standard of care. You shall ensure that
any recipients are bound by confidentiality terms at least as restrictive
as this Clause.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5B.2. You shall destroy any Confidential Information immediately upon
request by GovTech or the Third Party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5B.3. In the event:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>5B.3.1. you are, or likely to be, required by an order of court to disclose
Confidential Information; or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5B.3.2 you have reasonable grounds to suspect the unauthorised use or
disclosure or reproduction of Confidential Information;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>you shall immediately notify GovTech or the Third Party of the same and
cooperate with GovTech or the Third Party to prevent or limit such disclosure.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>5B.4. Nothing in this Clause 5B shall prejudice GovTech’s or the Third
Party’s other rights at law.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>6. Disclaimers and Indemnity</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>6.1. The Service is provided on an "as is" and “as available” basis without

reliance upon the Service,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>regardless of whether GovTech has been advised of the possibility of such
damage or loss.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>6.3. Without prejudice and in addition to the foregoing, insofar as the
Service facilitates or requires the provision, use or functioning of, or
is provided in conjunction with, other products, software, materials and/or
services not provided by GovTech, GovTech makes no representation or warranty
in relation to such products, software, materials and/or services (including

suitability or accuracy).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6.4. You shall not rely on any part of the Service to claim or assert
any form of legitimate expectation against GovTech, whether or not arising

<p>7.1. Insofar as the Service provides a hyperlink to material not maintained
or controlled by GovTech, GovTech shall not be responsible for the content
of the hyperlinked material and shall not be liable for any damages or
loss arising from access to the hyperlinked material. Use of the hyperlinks
and access to such hyperlinked materials are entirely at your own risk.

jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then these Terms of Use, including
all of the remaining terms, will remain in full force and effect as if

extent permissible, such invalid or unenforceable terms shall be deemed
to have been replaced by terms that are (a) valid and enforceable and (b)

30 days before the commencement of any legal action against it to elect

This right to elect shall not prejudice GovTech’s right to a limitation
defence and the period to exercise the right shall not be abridged by reason

<p><em>These Terms of Use are dated 3 August 2022</em>  <em>and will take effect from 15 September 2022.</em>
</p>
<p>Schedule</p>
<hr>
<p>1. Name of Service: Isomer</p>
<p>2. Nature of Service</p>
<p>a. Notwithstanding anything in the Terms of Use, the Service is intended
for use by a Singapore public sector agency or a healthcare institution
that is under the NHG, SingHealth, or NUHS healthcare clusters only, or
otherwise indicated by the Ministry of Health (MOH), or allowed by GovTech
from time to time (each a “<strong>Permitted Entity</strong>” or “<strong>you</strong>”).
You shall not use the Service unless you are authorised by a Permitted
Entity to bind it to the Terms of Use and act for and on behalf of the
Permitted Entity. GovTech may in its sole and absolute discretion implement
such security and/or identification measures to ensure that only Permitted
Entities are able to use the Service. Please further note that while a
Permitted Entity may authorise external vendors to use the Service for
and on behalf of the Permitted Entity, the use and/or access rights of
such external vendors may be restricted by GovTech in its sole and absolute
discretion. The Permitted Entity shall be responsible for the acts and
omissions of the external vendors or anyone else using or accessing the
Service under the Permitted Entity’s name or account, or on behalf of the
Permitted Entity.</p>
<p>b. This Service is a static website builder tool for the Permitted Entities
(listed in sub-paragraph (a) above) to build their own static informational
websites and host websites built using the tool. GovTech will operate,
develop and maintain until it determines to cease doing so in accordance
with the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>c. The Service requires the Permitted Entity to have its own Github account,
and the code for the website built will be made available to the public
via a Github repository. The Permitted Entity accepts that the licence
terms stipulated by GovTech applying to the contents of the Github repository
will apply to the Permitted Entity as well as any other person who may
access the Github repository. For the avoidance of doubt: (i) the Permitted
Entity accepts that such other persons will hence also have a licence to
the said contents and (ii) the terms of that licence will supersede anything
to the contrary in the Terms of Use or Privacy Statement, only to the extent
the licence applies to the contents of the Github repository. If the Permitted
Entity does not agree to the licence terms to such contents as may be amended
by GovTech from time to time, the Permitted Entity shall cease use of the
Service and all rights of the Permitted Entity to the Service and the website
built or hosted by the Service shall terminate.</p>
<p>d. The Terms of Use and Privacy Statement does not vest in the Permitted
Entity any intellectual property created or licensed by GovTech.</p>
<p>e. Domain maintenance and custom SSL certificate maintenance issues are
the Permitted Entity's sole responsibility. GovTech is not responsible
for such issues.</p>
<p>f. Please note that GovTech may collect, store and/or process data relating
to the websites created by the Service.</p>
<p>g. You are responsible for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>i. the management of users editing the content of the website. For this
purpose, you and your site owners or administrators shall also be responsible
for adding/removing users as and when necessary. For the avoidance of doubt,
such users include any external vendors engaged by you to manage the website;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ii. ensuring that users manage their user accounts appropriately (e.g.
not distributing passwords or OTP to unauthorized personnel);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iii. ensuring that the content published in the website is unclassified
and meant to be distributed to the public, and for compliance with any
other applicable laws, rules or regulations (such as any Government Instruction
Manuals);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>iv. obtaining and maintaining (including, where applicable, renewal, security
and configuration of) the domain name of the website, DNS service, and
SSL certificates except where otherwise agreed with GovTech;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>v. the acts and omissions of any person you request to be allowed as a
user of, or authorizes to use, the Service and the content such person
causes to publish. GovTech will not be liable for such acts, omissions,
or content;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vi. any issues concerning the website you create, the content you share
on your website and dealing with the site visitors or any other person
concerning your website, including without limitation the use, linking,
or publication of your own terms and/or privacy policy/statement applying
to the website. GovTech is not responsible for your compliance with the
applicable rules or laws, or for any failure by you to provide terms or
a privacy policy/statement. You are responsible for publishing your own
terms of use and privacy policy/statement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>h. You may terminate the Terms of Use by giving GovTech one month’s written
